Framework for testing Dijkstra's algorithm
===============================

This project aims to measure different implementation of one of the most known single source shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. All the theoritical knowledge can be found in CLRS 24.3. The get deeper understanding on the measurement, I have decided to split the introduction into 3 parts:

* All about Dijkstra's algorithm
* Data generation and measurement scenarios
* Results
