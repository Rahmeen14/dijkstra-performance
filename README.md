Framework for testing Dijkstra's algorithm
===============================

This project aims to measure the performance of different implementation of one of the most known single source shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. I am considering the naive, the binary heap and the Fibonacci heap implementation where I am using existing open-source implementation of the Fibonacci heap. My goal with this experiment is to show different implementation's strength. All the theoritical knowledge can be found in CLRS 24.3 and CLRS 17. To get deeper understanding on the measurement, I have decided to split the introduction into 3 parts:

* All about Dijkstra's algorithm
* Data generation and measurement scenarios
* Results
